# Diabetes_Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The prediction is made using machine learning algorithms on a dataset containing various features related to health parameters. The model is trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset to ensure accurate predictions.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd diabetes-prediction`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the prediction model, execute the `predict.py` script after installing the dependencies. Follow the instructions provided by the script to input the required health parameters for the prediction.

```bash
python predict.py
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [https://www.dropbox.com/s/uh7o7uyeghqkhoy/diabetes.csv?dl=0]. It contains various health parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, age, and other relevant features for individuals. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality and reliability of the predictions.

## Model

The prediction model is built using SVM  algorithm, chosen for its performance and interpretability in the context of diabetes prediction. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and validated on another to ensure its accuracy and generalizability. Extensive hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are employed to optimize the model's performance.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in predicting the presence of diabetes in individuals. Detailed analysis and visualizations of the results are included in the `results` directory of the repository.
